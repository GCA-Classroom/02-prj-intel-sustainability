# Bootstrap Timeline App

## Overview
This project implements a timeline layout using Bootstrap's grid system, designed to support right-to-left (RTL) text flow. The timeline is structured in a three-column layout, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that includes Bootstrap CSS and JS files. It structures the timeline using Bootstrap's grid classes.
- **css/custom.css**: A CSS file for custom styles that complement Bootstrap and ensure proper appearance for the RTL layout.
- **js/main.js**: A JavaScript file that handles interactivity on the timeline, such as showing and hiding details for each timeline entry.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd bootstrap-timeline-app
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`**: Use a web browser to open the `index.html` file. This file includes all necessary Bootstrap files and custom scripts.

3. **Customize Styles**: Modify the `css/custom.css` file to add any additional styles you may need for your project.

4. **Add Interactivity**: Use the `js/main.js` file to implement any JavaScript functionality required for your timeline.

## Usage
- The timeline is structured in a three-column layout, allowing for easy viewing of events.
- The text flows from right to left, suitable for languages that require RTL support.
